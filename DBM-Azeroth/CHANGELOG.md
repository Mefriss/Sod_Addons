## [1.15.7](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Classic/tree/1.15.7) (2024-01-09)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Classic/compare/1.15.6...1.15.7) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Classic/releases)

- bump versions, prepare new tag for all  
- Update dropdowns with groupings  
- begin, and stop work on adding missing strings to other files. That's probably all I'm gonna do cause it's way too much work with how crappy and disorganized files are. Makes me appreciate the localizers that do update these even more. I certainly don't have time or patience for it.  
- further tweaks  
- minor code tweak  
- Update koKR (#363)  
- Update localization.tw.lua (#362)  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#361)  
- Update dropdowns with groupings  
- Group loathab dropdown  
- Fix dropdown autopositioning if no previous element.  
- Fix description parsing for dropdown options.  
- Dropdowns still don't render at all if they don't have an option above them to anchor to, and since groupbyspells has removed most from misc section, added misc lines above all dropdowns as fallback  
- Fix a bug that caused boss distance checks to fail when out of range, due to a bad logic check for success. It needs to be specifically a nil check and not a nil and false check  
- update checkout  
- Add a nice simple reset button to chat frame selection  
- Bracket struggles.  
- another naming fix. I'll actually fix this correctly by eliminating fragmentation of this mod later.  
- Add UI option to select chat frame for DBM messages v2 (#360)  
- update versioncheck  
- reclassify world boss mod  
- reclassify world boss mod  
- Correctly sort World Boss tab and other tab  
- Fix another removed change, hopefully without deleting entire repo due to sourcetree bug  
- sourcetree is fucking stupid  
- GUI Updates (#354) Co-authored-by: Adam <MysticalOS@users.noreply.github.com>  
- note fix  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#357)  
- Update koKR (#358)  
- Missed this too (BTW, verify your localized text cause I did my best guesswork with editing them)  
- These options no longer control combat timers, since they are no longer hacked/dummy objects they follow normal timer conventions (meaning you enable/disable the countdown via GUI option within individual mods)  
- Locale-BR: correct combat text tense (#356)  
- Revert someof combat to RP timer changes, since I reworked and restored object and I do still want distinction of combat auto starts from rp \"this doesn't auto engage\" timers  
- Reconstructed NewCombatTimer in standard auto timer texts so it's not injected into old enrage object.  
- also change packaging name since i keep forgetting  
- also change packaging name since i keep forgetting  
- Forgot to replace the one that actually started journey of me finding the bug.  
- replace all uses of NewCombatTimer with NewRPTimer  
- Obliterate the NewCombatTimer object. It hasn't worked in the entire 9 or so years it existed, so no reason to start using it now, RP timer serves same function and actually works  
- replace all uses of NewCombatTimer with NewRPTimer  
- use the season 3 dungeon ids, not season 1, oops  
- Fixed a bug where available mod notice would show every time you enter a dragonflight dungeon, it should only show once Fixed a different bug where it would NOT show when you entered a non dragonflight seasonal dungeon.  
- add a feature that plays debug sound for timer debug messages, can be toggled off/on with /dbm debugsound  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#355)  
- It's about time to change this text to not say twitter, and just say \"most socials\" instead  
- scope ashenvale pvp mod alert to only alert if level 25 and walking in zone. This will prevent message showing if leveling in zone or just flying over it.  
- update luacheck
